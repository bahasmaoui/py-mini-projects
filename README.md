# py-mini-projects
These are mini projects I did on python


# quiz game
This is a Harry Potter (for now) Quiz Game, I'm planning to add new themes in the future and more questions but I gotta create a huge file with themes and questions for each theme
There is obviously a system of points, in the future, maybe I'll make it multiplayer, like you could have multiple saves and each player has a score and there is a score board system with the top 5.

# number guesser
It's easy, it's based on the random lib, you just guess the number and it counts how many tries
It reminds me of wordle, I'm thinking of adding a feature in the future where it give you hints about the number (arithmatic) 
in the future I hope

# rock paper scissors game
pretty straight forward, but I'm thinking of adding twists like "secret items" that you could use and there is like 7 of them and you have to discover them all

# password manager
This is to manage your passowrds, there isn't really anything special, it's efficient and I had fun making it

# wordle
it is a python version of wordle, with difficulty levels (the number of letters in a word)
